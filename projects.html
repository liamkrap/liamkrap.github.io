                    <h3>Mahogany Heirloom Box</h3>
                    <p>Handmade heirloom box, created with bookmatched Mahogany timber, and a friction fit Tasmanian Blackwood insert. The box has been constructed using reinforced mitres and finished with Osmo topcoat. The lid is inspired by 80's design, and has been made using Black Walnut and Tasmanian Oak veneers, with perpendicular grain directions.</p>

                    <p>Handmade desk lamp made from Mahogany timber, and copper. The lamp is inspired by industrial style designs, with adjustable arms to change the angle of the light. The copper lampshade was cut and shaped from a copper sheet, which I then applied a stipled effect to, to further diffuse the light.</p>

                    <h3>Brass and Copper Earrings</h3>
                    <p>The earrings were inspired by raindrops falling on a pond. The copper has been cut into a teardrop shape to emulate a rain droplet. The brass has been hammered into a bowl shape, overlayed with a stippling effect to emulate raindrops on the surface of water. These components have then been threaded onto fish hook earings blanks.</p>

                    <h3>Flat Bar Hacksaw</h3>
                    <p>The hacksaw has been fabricated using a range of materials and processes. The frame was manufactured using flat bar steel, which has had a bend forged into the front of it, and the handle and blade holder welded on. The frame assembly has then been coated in a blue paint. The handle has been 3D printed using exact tolerances to allow for a friction fit onto the frame.</p>

                    <p>The jeweler's hammer has been constructed using a combination of mild steel, brass, aluminium, and acrylic. The porject was an exercise in precise machining with a specific focus on lathe use. The aluminium and brass heads have a thread cut into them so they're able to be screwed onto the main assembly.</p>

                    <p>The ladle was an introductory metalwork project, constructed from brass and copper. The brass handle was cut and shaped with a curl and ergonomic bend. Attached with brass rivets, the bowl of the ladle was cut from copper sheet, shaped using a timber mold, then hammered with a ball pein hammer to give it a dimpled effect.</p>

                    <p>The phone safe was an introductory woodwork project, to develop our skills in measuring, marking out, use of hand tools, and CAD. The box is constructed out of pine, with a clear acrylic lid that slides through a channel which was cut on the table saw. On the lid, we were able to design a decal using Adobe Illustrator, which was then engraved using the laser cutter.</p>

All the components have essentially been folded or riveted together. The toolbox also has an additional sliding tray that rests on rails.</p>

                    <p>My current project is an upholstered armchair constructed from Tasmanian Blackwood. The expected completion is early November. The project is a culmination of all that I have learnt throughout my Industrial Technology major units, and will signify the completion of my Technology units.</p>
