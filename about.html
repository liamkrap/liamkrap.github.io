            Hi, my name is Liam, I'm a Uni student and the Australian Catholic University in Strathfield. I'm currently studying a Bachlor of Education Secondary and Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation and Technologies), which will allow me to be a high school TAS teacher. I'm majoring in Industrial Technology (Timber and Metal) and minoring in Textiles and Digital Technologies. I've worked with Primary School aged students for 8 years, so I'm looking forward to working with High School aged students and the different challenges and rewards that come with that age group.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm passionate about all things relating to design, and particularly enjoy the design process; identifying a need, proposing a solution, endless ideation, reflection, evaluation, and finally the physical realisation of a product. Within this, I find the ideation process to be the most enjoyable, I have always been fond of sketching, and I think it's amazing to look back at how an idea came to be through countless versions and adjustments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout my studies I have developed my knowledge and skills within the workshop, building proficiencies with many tools and practices. On the right you can see a list of tools that I am familiar with at varying levels. Not listed is CAD, my greatest achievement is my knowledge and skill within Fusion360. Over the past three years I have spent a lot of time self-directing my own learning within the program, so that I can use it to its full potential.
        </p>

        <p>
            So far, I have completed three 3-week placements, with one remaining in 2026 which will be 7 weeks. Below it is a list of the schools I was able to learn from and the disciplines which I taught in. Interestingly, my experience has only been with single-gender schools - all girls at Roseville and Mercy, and all boys at Holy Cross. I'm looking forward to the day that I get to experience teaching at a co-ed school as it will again be a different dynamic.
