                        <p>Develop a prototype of a device that utilises simple hydraulics to lift an item from point A to point B. the prototype must be accompanied by a rationale explaining the chosen design elements and linking engineering principles. Students develop knowledge on control systems and their real-life relevance and apply engineering principles to evaluate factors affecting the design of engineered control systems. Students develop their technical drawing skills, CAD skills, design communication skills, and make connections to industry practices. Students get hands-on experience with rapid prototyping processes and apply engineering design principles to redesign a component of a hydraulic arm.</p>

                        <h3>Stage 6 Design and Technology Sustainability Unit</h3>
                        <p>This unit is focussed on the first of two mini projects in the HSC Design and Technology preliminary course. The project is focussed on rethinking existing products or manufacturing techniques to consider more sustainable options. Students will develop an understanding of sustainable manufacturing techniques and materials through redesigning an existing everyday product (for example: water bottle, shopping bag, phone case, etc.). This unit also seeks to provide students with the opportunity of utilising AI, specifically Generative AI, as an aid in the design process in the hopes of helping students understand the ethical, safety, and legal considerations of using AI. At the end of the unit, students will have created a high-quality final prototype as well as a folio that effectively communicates and evaluates the design process.</p>
