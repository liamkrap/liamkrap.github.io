          <h2>My Teaching Practice</h2>
          <p>
            As a TAS teacher specialising in Industrial Technology, my practice is centred on fostering creativity,
            problem-solving, and practical skill development. I aim to equip students with the confidence to work
            safely and independently in workshop environments, while encouraging collaboration and reflective practice.
            Through design thinking pedagogies, such as inquiry-based learning and project-based learning, students
            explore authentic problems and generate innovative solutions. I promote critical and creative thinking by
            guiding students to analyse, evaluate, and refine their ideas through iterative design processes. In the
            workshop, I focus on building students' technical proficiency and resilience, ensuring they feel capable
            and confident when using tools, machinery, and materials. By linking hands-on experiences with theory, I
            create opportunities for students to see the real-world relevance of their learning, preparing them to
            become adaptable, resourceful, and ethical designers in a rapidly changing world.

          <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I want to foster a positive, engaging environment where students are enjoying the content they are learning
            or at least understand the task in front of them. There should be a level of understanding from students
            where they can work autonomously at the task at hand. Students should feel supported and encouraged to take
            risks, experiment with ideas, and learn from both successes and setbacks. I believe that education is not
            just about imparting knowledge but about inspiring curiosity and a lifelong love of learning. My role as a
            teacher is to guide students in discovering their own potential, building their confidence, and developing
            the skills they need to navigate challenges both inside and outside the classroom.
