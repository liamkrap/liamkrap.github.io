        <h2>My Teaching Practice</h2>
            <p>
                As a TAS teacher specialising in Industrial Technology, my practice is centred on fostering creativity, problem-solving, and practical skill development. I aim to equip students with the confidence to work safely and independently in workshop environments, while encouraging collaboration and reflective practice. Through design thinking pedagogies, such as inquiry-based learning and project-based learning, students explore authentic problems and generate innovative solutions. I promote critical and creative thinking by guiding students to analyse, evaluate, and refine their ideas through iterative design processes. In the workshop, I focus on building students' technical proficiency and resilience, ensuring they feel capable and confident when using tools, machinery, and materials. By linking hands-on experiences with theory, I create opportunities for students to see the real-world relevance of their learning, preparing them to become adaptable, resourceful, and ethical designers in a rapidly changing world.
            </p>

        <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                I want to foster a positive, engaging environment where students are enjoying the content they are learning or at least understand the task in front of them. There should be a level of understanding from students where they can work autonomously at the task at hand. Students should feel as though they can reach out to their peers and the teacher. The environment should be calm, easy, respectful of each other's time, space, and knowledge. There should be a level of mutual respect where students feel like people and individuals, but also understand they have a responsibility to listen to the instructions of the teacher. The environment should be supportive; students should feel supported by each other.
